/*  UnoJoy.h
 *   Alan Chatham - 2012
 *    RMIT Exertion Games Lab
 *
 *  This library gives you a standard way to create Arduino code that talks
 *   to the UnoJoy firmware in order to make native USB game controllers.
 *  Functions:
 *   setupMegaJoy()
 *   getBlankDataForController()
 *   setControllerData(megaJoyControllerData_t dataToSet)
 *
 *   NOTE: You cannot use pins 0 or 1 if you use this code - they are used by the serial communication.
 *         Also, the setupMegaJoy() function starts the serial port at 38400, so if you're using
 *         the serial port to debug and it's not working, this may be your problem.
 *   
 *   === How to use this library ===
 *   If you want, you can move this file into your Arduino/Libraries folder, then use it like a normal library.
 *   However, since you'll need to refer to the details of the megaJoyControllerData_t struct in this file, I would suggest you use
 *    it by adding it to your Arduino sketch manually (in Arduino, go to Sketch->Add file...)
 *
 *  To use this library to make a controller, you'll need to do 3 things:
 *   Call setupMegaJoy(); in the setup() block
 *   Create and populate a megaJoyControllerData_t type variable and fill it with your data
 *         The getBlankDataForController() function is good for that.
 *   Call setControllerData(yourData); where yourData is the variable from above,
 *         somewhere in your loop(), once you're ready to push your controller data to the system.
 *         If you forget to call sendControllerData in your loop, your controller won't ever do anything
 *
 *  You can then debug the controller with the included Processing sketch, UnoJoyProcessingVisualizer
 *  
 *  To turn it into an actual USB video game controller, you'll reflash the
 *   Arduino's communication's chip using the instructions found in the 'Firmware' folder,
 *   then unplug and re-plug in the Arduino. 
 * 
 *  Details about the megaJoyControllerData_t type are below, but in order to create and use it,
 *   you'll declare it like:
 *
 *      megaJoyControllerData_t sexyControllerData;
 *
 *   and then control button presses and analog stick movement with statements like:
 *      
 *      sexyControllerData.triangleOn = 1;   // Marks the triangle button as pressed
 *      sexyControllerData.squareOn = 0;     // Marks the square button as unpressed
 *      sexyControllerData.leftStickX = 90;  // Analog stick values can range from 0 - 255
